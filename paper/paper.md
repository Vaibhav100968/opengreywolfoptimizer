# Summary

Optimization problems are ubiquitous across scientific computing, engineering, and machine learning applications. From hyperparameter tuning in neural networks to parameter estimation in scientific models, the need for robust and efficient optimization algorithms continues to grow. Traditional gradient-based methods often struggle with multimodal, discontinuous, or noisy objective functions, creating demand for metaheuristic algorithms that can handle complex optimization landscapes without requiring gradient information.

`GreyWolfOptimizer` is a Python package implementing the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm, a nature-inspired metaheuristic that mimics the leadership hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves [@Mirjalili:2014]. The package provides a user-friendly interface that makes advanced optimization techniques accessible to both researchers and practitioners. The implementation features optional MPI parallelization for large-scale problems, flexible configuration options, and comprehensive documentation with type hints throughout.

The Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm maintains a social hierarchy among candidate solutions (wolves), with the three best solutions designated as alpha (α), beta (β), and delta (δ) wolves that guide the pack's hunting behavior. The remaining solutions are considered omega (ω) wolves that follow the guidance of the three leaders. This hierarchical structure provides excellent exploration-exploitation balance through a decreasing parameter that transitions the algorithm from exploration to exploitation over iterations, making GWO particularly effective for complex multimodal optimization problems.

The `GreyWolfOptimizer` package was designed for researchers in computational science, engineers solving design optimization problems, and data scientists requiring robust optimization capabilities. The package provides a simple `.fit()` interface that requires minimal setup while offering advanced features including custom bounds per dimension, multiple verbosity levels for progress monitoring, and distributed computing support through MPI. The implementation emphasizes performance through efficient NumPy operations [@numpy:2020] and optional MPI parallelization [@mpi4py:2021] for computationally expensive objective functions.

Key features of the implementation include:
- Intuitive interface following Python best practices
- Support for box constraints with per-dimension bounds
- Three levels of verbosity for monitoring optimization progress  
- Optional MPI parallelization for expensive function evaluations
- Comprehensive type hints and documentation
- Built-in benchmark functions for testing and validation

The combination of ease-of-use, performance optimization, and comprehensive documentation makes `GreyWolfOptimizer` a valuable addition to the scientific Python ecosystem. The source code is available under an open-source license and includes extensive examples demonstrating usage on various optimization problems.

# Statement of need

Many optimization problems in scientific computing and engineering involve objective functions that are multimodal, discontinuous, derivative-free, or computationally expensive to evaluate. Traditional optimization methods like gradient descent require differentiable functions and can easily become trapped in local optima when dealing with complex landscapes. While established libraries like SciPy [@scipy:2020] provide some metaheuristic algorithms, there remains a need for specialized implementations of modern nature-inspired algorithms that offer both high performance and user-friendly interfaces.

The `GreyWolfOptimizer` package addresses this gap by providing a high-quality implementation of the GWO algorithm with several key advantages over existing solutions:

1. **Accessible Interface**: A familiar `.fit()` method interface that follows Python conventions, making it easy for users to integrate into existing workflows
2. **Scalable Performance**: Optional MPI parallelization enables efficient optimization of expensive objective functions across multiple processes
3. **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive type hints, detailed documentation, and multiple verbosity levels support both novice and expert users
4. **Flexible Configuration**: Support for different bound types, population sizes, and convergence criteria allows adaptation to diverse problem characteristics

These features make advanced metaheuristic optimization techniques accessible to a broader audience while maintaining the computational performance required for research applications. The package fills an important niche for users who need robust optimization capabilities without the complexity often associated with advanced metaheuristic implementations.

# Implementation

The `GreyWolfOptimizer` class implements the core GWO algorithm with modern Python practices. The optimization process follows the natural hunting behavior of grey wolves, where the pack collaboratively hunts prey under the guidance of dominant wolves. In each iteration, wolves update their positions based on the locations of the three best solutions (alpha, beta, delta wolves), with a linearly decreasing parameter controlling the balance between exploration and exploitation.

The package leverages NumPy for efficient numerical computations and includes optional MPI support through mpi4py for parallel function evaluations. The implementation handles edge cases gracefully, validates input parameters, and provides meaningful error messages to guide users toward correct usage.
